Shortly after, I sought every opportunity available to learn skills by obtaining apprenticeships with top-class natural builders across the world.

Time and again in these workshops, with the guidance of brilliant mentors, I saw empowerment happen. I witnessed people of widely diverse backgrounds, from the struggling single mother to the estranged radical environmentalist, learn from the group process and from sharing life experience together. I was constantly inspired to orchestrate such events and to perpetuate these experiences, a camaraderie formed in mud.

Being a fervent believer in community and sustainable lifestyles, my dream is to make Natural Building technologies more accessible and well known.

Ready to plant roots into a community, I settled in Berkeley, California after finishing an internship in Natural Building and orchard care in Yolo County. Choosing the hub of urban art and progressive innovations was a clear easy choice. I landed at Green Faerie Farm, helping to manage animals onsite, and began a contracting/carpentry apprenticeship to further expand hands-on building experience. Being in the Bay Area fosters my connection to the building community and has helped shape my experiences into a career.

Although the core of my experience lies in Natural Building and Carpentry, my goal is to integrate all systems of self-reliance and sufficiency to create human ecosystems to heal the planet. This is the type of community I wish to contribute to."},

React has many selling points: a lighting-quick Virtual DOM, modular components, JSX syntax, Fluxâ€™s unidirectional flow data, and much more.

One of the best things about React and Flux are their simplicity: JSX resembles HTML/XML, and Flux is more of a pattern then a framework, so it can be implemented without having to learn much new code. While relatively easy to learn, they are powerful tools for building large applications with data that changes over time.

Your host for this workshop is Experiencelyâ€™s founder, Noah Wiener, who designed the Experiencely website using React and Flux architecture on top of a Rails backend.  Noah is a soon-to-be graduate of San Franciscoâ€™s prestigious App Academy, a web development bootcamp focusing on Rails and React development.

This workshop will be held in the heart of San Franciscoâ€™s tech scene at the App Academy offices. The workshop will go back-and-forth between demo and lecture, as Noah introduces guests to React components, the React router, and Fluxâ€™s unidirectional data model. At the end of the lecture, guests will each sit down at a computer and work through Experiencelyâ€™s source code to see React in action!"

The Mindful Garden Collective is a social innovation project lead by students that empowers other students to create their own adventure through the revitalization and expansion of an urban space. We are committed to the wellness of our locality by providing organic food to those in need and by hosting a space for community gatherings. We believe in serving the community as a part of a larger effort to consciously influence the evolution of the planet in the name of synergy, compassion, and love.

The Laney edible garden is located in Oakland, CA in the Peralta district next to Lake Merritt. It was first started six years ago by a man who has been supporting agricultural growth and restoration throughout the Eastbay his entire life. Kenneth Kolevzon aka Grey is a key activist, teacher, and friend who supports some of the most influential projects throughout the bay. He started the Laney garden just so he would have an outdoors space to teach his High School class about the land. He continued to restore the land and expand the garden until it was big enough to feed hundreds.

We are an inner city community college serving a diverse population and our vision is to bring every one together by co-creating an outdoors inclusive wellness center. Our goals are to connect students to their food source, encourage emotional growth, community support, and restorative justice. We are currently awaiting approval to expand our space and build a food forest across the Lake Merritt canal. We host nonprofits, k-12, and are working towards becoming restitution. The garden is a place for the community to learn and grow together while supporting students to broaden their understanding of the world and realize the infinite possibilities that are available to them.

Dormant forces, faculties and talents become alive, and you discover yourself to be a greater person by far than you ever dreamed yourself to be.' ",
